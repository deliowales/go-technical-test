# Delio Go Technical Test

Delio engineering have been tasked with checking the current price of APPL and MSFT shares and comparing them the previous day's closing price.

## The task

It's your job to create a service to use the finnhub's API (https://finnhub.io/docs/api/quote) to compare the current price of 10 APPL and 10 MSFT shares with their previous day's closing price. To complete this task, you'll need to:

* Create a a CLI application in Go
* Retrieve share value of MSFT and APPL shares from finnhub
* Run profit & loss calculation on both MSFT & APPL shares
* Return values to command line
* Add tests

Optional extras:

* Utilise the concurrency of Go for API calls & profit and loss calculations
* Add a benchmark to the service

## The rest

Feel free to use any external packages.

Please do not hesitate to get in touch with any questions you have during the process.
